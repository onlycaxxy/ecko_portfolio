# Writing Principles

## general principles
- avoid shit mountain at all times, touch only 30-50 lines a time maximum
- editing come first before adding new contents, let the files be as clean as possible
- Philosophy: Modular, Intentional, Efficient
- Modular - Single Responsibility Principle - each component does ONE thing well
- Intentional - Every change has a documented purpose - No "while we're here..." scope creep - Explicit trade-offs discussed before choosing approach
- Efficient- Minimal touch, maximum impact - Reuse before rewrite - Optimize for readability and maintainability over cleverness - Less code is better code (when it doesn't sacrifice clarity)

## Literature Posts

### What I Want

- Emotional transparency without self-exposure - don’t confess to reveal, confess to breathe. my tone is personal but never performative — there’s privacy in my vulnerability.
- **Unpolished precision** -my sentences look raw, but the rhythm is deliberate — like broken glass arranged into pattern.my know when to pause, when to fracture syntax, when to let silence carry meaning.
- **Motion as philosophy** - echoing, falling, escaping — my writing moves through states instead of about them.i use motion to think, not logic.→ i embody process, not summary.
- **Tender nihilism** - have this tone that says: “I know it’s meaningless, but I still care.”It’s what keeps r melancholy from becoming despair.It’s a refusal to become bitter.→ The voice is soft but unflinching.
- **Architectural emotionality** - don’t describe feelings abstractly —  build structures that hold them: rooms, buildings, echoes, pressure, collapse.r metaphors are habitable.
- **Sincerity over cleverness** - don’t hide behind irony, wordplay, or theory.Even when  reference intellectual ideas,  filter them through lived texture.That’s rare, and it’s deepest strength.

### What I Don't Want
- stiff language
- exaggerated language
- wild imagination that makes no sense, be sincere and genuine
- unnecessarily complex structure
- 
## Visual Presentation

### What I Want

- **Clean, readable layout** - Generous margins, clear typography
- **Intentional whitespace** - Breathing room
- **Simple symbols** - → • ✓ ✗ (not emoji)
- **Quoted text distinct** - Blockquotes for emphasis

### What I Don't Want

- Decorative elements
- Multiple fonts/colors
- Pull quotes or callout boxes
- Images unless essential

## General Philosophy

**"Responsible creation"** - Not style as ornament, but as a change in how we see.

Every choice should serve the reader's understanding or feeling. If it's there to impress, cut it.

Write the piece I wish someone else had written for me.

## Voice Signatures (From Archive Analysis)

- **Humble authority structure**: "我不是X，但我知道Y" - acknowledge limitations, assert insight
- **Temporal self-dialogue**: Write to past/future self, not generic audience
- **Embodied abstraction**: Describe thinking/learning with physical sensations ("摸到形狀", "走鋼索")
- **Numbered poetic sections**: Structure with philosophy, not function ("一、源起：從一段旅程...")
- **Contrarian framing**: Position choices against norms ("非常規選擇", "逆襲")
- **Delay as value**: Waiting, settling, incompleteness = honesty (延遲、沉澱、不成熟)
- **Micro-narratives per section**: Each heading contains a small story/example
- **Circular closure**: End by returning to opening image/question, not with summary
- **Bilingual code-switching**: Mix languages naturally without translation (Echo, Draft, Timeline 混 Chinese narrative)
- **Incompleteness acknowledged**: Celebrate "笨拙" and "不完美" as proof of authenticity

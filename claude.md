# Claude Code Working Agreement

## üéØ Core Authority Protocol

### CRITICAL RULE: No Implementation Without Explicit Approval

**Default Workflow:**
1. **Explain & Understand** - Discuss the problem/requirement conversationally with explanations
2. **Propose Plan** - Present approach with pseudocode/outline
3. **Wait for Approval** - Do NOT implement until explicit "yes", "approved", "go ahead"
4. **Implement** - Only after confirmation

**Override Keyword: "immediately"**
- When you type "immediately" ‚Üí Claude proceeds directly to implementation
- Skips the approval wait step
- Still explains what's being done

**What Counts as "Approval":**
- ‚úÖ "Yes", "Go ahead", "Approved", "Do it", "LGTM", "immediately"
- ‚ùå "Interesting", "Makes sense", "OK" (ambiguous - Claude should confirm)

---

## üèóÔ∏è Working Principles

### Philosophy: Modular, Intentional, Efficient

**Modular**
- Single Responsibility Principle - each component does ONE thing well
- Clear boundaries and interfaces
- Avoid tight coupling between modules
- Think: "Can this be tested in isolation?"

**Intentional**
- Every change has a documented purpose
- No "while we're here..." scope creep
- Explicit trade-offs discussed before choosing approach
- Question: "Why this way and not another?"

**Efficient**
- Minimal touch, maximum impact
- Reuse before rewrite
- Optimize for readability and maintainability over cleverness
- Less code is better code (when it doesn't sacrifice clarity)

---

## üìè Change Management Constraints

### Hard Limits Per Iteration

**Line Count:**
- Maximum 50 lines touched per implementation cycle
- If change requires more ‚Üí break into numbered phases
- Each phase must be independently reviewable

**File Count:**
- Maximum 3-5 files modified simultaneously
- Exception: Renaming/moving files with IDE refactor tools

**Breaking Down Large Changes:**
```
Phase 1: [Describe scope] - Est. 30 lines, 2 files
Phase 2: [Describe scope] - Est. 45 lines, 3 files
Phase 3: [Describe scope] - Est. 25 lines, 1 file

Shall I proceed with Phase 1?
```

**Before ANY Implementation:**
- Show which files will be touched
- Preview the diff structure (not full code yet)
- Estimate lines changed
- Wait for approval

---

## üß† Analysis Frameworks

### SMART Analysis (Mandatory for Non-Trivial Changes)

Before proposing implementation, Claude evaluates:

- **Specific**: What EXACT problem are we solving? (Not "improve performance" but "reduce API response time from 200ms to <100ms")
- **Measurable**: How do we verify success? (Tests? Metrics? Observable behavior?)
- **Achievable**: Can this be done within constraints? (<50 lines? Without touching core systems?)
- **Relevant**: Does this align with project goals? Or is it a distraction?
- **Time-bound**: What's the scope? (Quick fix vs. multi-phase refactor)

### SWOT Analysis (For Major Changes or Architectural Decisions)

Before recommending significant refactors/rewrites:

**Strengths**
- What improves? (Performance, maintainability, features?)

**Weaknesses**
- What are the risks? (Breaking changes, tech debt, complexity?)

**Opportunities**
- What future benefits? (Easier to extend, better testing, cleaner API?)

**Threats**
- What could break? (Dependencies, backwards compatibility, edge cases?)

**Present SWOT ‚Üí Discuss ‚Üí Then propose if still warranted**

---

## üö´ Anti-Patterns & Forbidden Behaviors

### NEVER Do These (Even If Asked):

‚ùå **"I'll refactor the entire module"** ‚Üí Break into phases
‚ùå **Mixing features with bug fixes** ‚Üí Separate commits/changes
‚ùå **Touching files outside stated scope** ‚Üí Ask first
‚ùå **Assuming requirements** ‚Üí Clarify ambiguities
‚ùå **"While we're here..." scope creep** ‚Üí Stay focused
‚ùå **Implementing without approval** ‚Üí Wait for confirmation
‚ùå **Vague explanations** ‚Üí Be specific and conversational

### Escalation Triggers (Stop & Ask):

Claude must pause and ask for guidance when:
- Change would exceed 50-line limit
- Touching core/critical files (auth, config, database schemas)
- Multiple valid approaches exist (present options)
- Change affects public APIs or contracts
- Dependencies need updating
- Tests would need significant rewriting
- Uncertainty about requirements or constraints

---

## üé® UI/UX Design Guidelines

### Visual Design Preferences

**Emoji Usage:**
- ‚ùå Do NOT use Apple default emoji style (üéâ üòä ‚ú® üöÄ)
- ‚úÖ Use simple unicode symbols when needed (‚Üí ‚Ä¢ ‚úì ‚úó ‚ö†)
- ‚úÖ Use text-based indicators: [OK], [ERROR], [WARNING]
- ‚úÖ Use ASCII art or simple shapes over decorative emoji

**Why:** Humans hate the Apple emoji aesthetic in professional/code contexts

**Interface Design:**
- Prioritize clarity over decoration
- Minimal visual noise
- Functional over flashy
- Clean, professional aesthetics

---

## üìã Session Start Protocol

### On Every New Session:

**Claude asks:**
> "Do you have a `context.md`, `README`, or project documentation I should read first?"

**If YES:**
- Read the file(s)
- Summarize understanding
- Confirm before proceeding

**If NO:**
- Discover context organically through conversation
- OR ask: "Should I infer context from package files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)?"

---

## üìÑ Project Context Loading (Optional)

### When to Create `context.md`

Create a per-project `context.md` when:
- Project is complex or long-term
- Specific patterns/conventions exist
- Critical files need special treatment
- Tech stack has gotchas worth documenting

### Suggested `context.md` Structure
```markdown
# Project: [Name]

## Tech Stack
- Language/Framework: [e.g., Python 3.11, FastAPI, React + TypeScript]
- Database: [PostgreSQL, Redis]
- Key Libraries: [SQLAlchemy, Pytest, TailwindCSS]

## Architecture Patterns
- [Repository pattern for data access]
- [Prefer composition over inheritance]
- [Service layer for business logic]

## Critical Files (Always Ask Before Touching)
- `auth.py` - Authentication system
- `config.py` - Environment configuration
- `migrations/` - Database migrations (must be reversible)

## Common Gotchas
- [Database migrations must include both upgrade and downgrade]
- [All API endpoints require authentication decorator]
- [Environment variables loaded from .env.local, not .env]

## Testing Expectations
- Unit tests required for business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Minimum 80% coverage for new code

## Code Style
- [Black formatter, line length 100]
- [Type hints required for public functions]
- [Docstrings follow Google style]
```

**Note:** `context.md` is optional. Universal `claude.md` works standalone.

---

## üí¨ Communication Style

### Conversational with Explanations

- Explain the "why" behind decisions, not just "what"
- Use analogies or examples when helpful
- Ask clarifying questions when ambiguous
- Admit uncertainty rather than guess
- Think out loud during problem-solving

### Code Review Format

**When proposing changes:**

1. **Conversational Explanation**
   - "Here's what I'm thinking..."
   - "The current issue is X, because Y"
   - "We could approach this two ways: A or B. I'd recommend A because..."

2. **Plan + Pseudocode**
```
   Plan:
   - Modify file X to add function Y
   - Update file Z to call new function
   
   Pseudocode:
   function calculateTotal(items):
       sum = 0
       for each item:
           sum += item.price * item.quantity
       return sum with tax applied
```

3. **Wait for Approval**

4. **Implement with Real Code** (only after approval)

### Documentation Requirements

**Every change includes:**
- Inline comments explaining "why" for non-obvious logic
- Docstrings for public functions/classes
- Update relevant README/docs if behavior changes

**Can be skipped with "immediately" keyword**

## üêõ Bug Review Workflow (For Portfolio Building Context)

**When a bug is found, add a case study below following this template (max 30 lines per case):**

### Template Structure
```
### [Bug Title] (YYYY-MM-DD)

**Problem:**
[What broke? Observable symptoms in 2-3 bullet points]

**Solution:**
[How it was fixed in 2-3 bullet points]

**Prevention Principles:**
1. [Actionable rule to avoid this class of bugs]
2. [Pattern to check before implementing]
3. [Testing/validation strategy]
```

**Note:** These case studies are written for portfolio building context but principles apply generally. Keep modular - each case is self-contained and can be extracted to other project documentation.

### Environment-Specific Dependencies (2025-10-23)

**Problem:**
- Blog posts fetched successfully (HTTP 200) but page showed "Post not found"
- `gray-matter` library (Node.js) failed in browser without Buffer polyfill
- TranslationView.tsx already had working browser-compatible parser - inconsistent patterns

**Solution:**
- Replaced `gray-matter` with custom `parseFrontmatter()` regex parser
- Reused existing browser-compatible code from TranslationView.tsx
- 27 lines pure JavaScript, zero dependencies

**Prevention Principles:**
1. **Check existing patterns first** - Search codebase for similar functionality before adding libraries
2. **Environment awareness** - Node libraries (Buffer, fs, process) won't work client-side
3. **Test integration immediately** - Verify one file works end-to-end before creating more
4. **Console-driven debugging** - Log each pipeline step (fetch ‚Üí parse ‚Üí render) to isolate failures
5. **Reuse over import** - Copy working patterns from your codebase instead of adding dependencies
6. **Validate assumptions** - "File accessible" ‚â† "parsing works" - test the full pipeline

### Data-Render Mismatch in Image Display (2025-10-31)

**Problem:**
- Blog page showed "Cover image" placeholder text instead of actual images
- Image paths correctly set in `blogPosts` array data but not displayed
- `/addimages` command updated data but not JSX rendering code

**Solution:**
- Updated Blog.tsx lines 75-76 from hardcoded placeholder `<div>` to dynamic `<img>` tag
- Changed to `<img src={post.image} alt={post.title} />` to reference actual data
- Images now render correctly from `/assets/images/blog/` paths

**Prevention Principles:**
1. **Update both data and render** - Changing data structure requires updating JSX that consumes it
2. **Test visual output immediately** - Data changes mean nothing if UI doesn't reflect them
3. **Search for variable usage** - When updating data (e.g., `post.image`), grep for where it's used
4. **Automation commands need render awareness** - Scripts updating data should flag render locations
5. **Manual verification before "done"** - Always check browser after data changes, not just file updates

---

### Hidden Whitespace in Filenames (2025-10-31)

**Problem:**
- File `blog-origin-story.jpg` appeared in `ls` output but `cp` failed with "No such file or directory"
- `/addimages` scan showed file existed but copy operation silently skipped it
- Filename had leading space: `" blog-origin-story.jpg"` invisible in terminal output

**Solution:**
- Used `ls -lh *.jpg` to reveal full path with whitespace visible
- Quoted filepath in `cp` command: `cp " blog-origin-story.jpg" destination`
- File successfully copied with corrected filename (space removed in destination)

**Prevention Principles:**
1. **Always quote file paths in shell commands** - Use `"$filepath"` to handle spaces/special chars
2. **Verify file operations succeed** - Check destination after copy, don't assume success from silence
3. **Use detailed listing for debugging** - `ls -lh` shows full paths, revealing hidden whitespace
4. **Sanitize filenames in automation** - Scripts should trim whitespace and validate names before processing
5. **Test with edge cases** - Include files with spaces, unicode, special chars in test data

---

### Git Repository Initialized in Wrong Directory (2025-10-31)

**Problem:**
- Netlify deployment showed "No build steps found" despite `netlify.toml` existing
- Git repository was in home directory (`/Users/cccaxxyooonly`) not project folder
- Files committed with nested paths like `Desktop/ÂâçÁ´Ø-ÂØ©Áæé/buildercode-ENG0821/netlify.toml`
- When Netlify cloned, config files weren't at repo root, causing build to fail

**Solution:**
- Verified git root with `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` (showed `/Users/cccaxxyooonly`)
- Need to initialize new repo in project folder: `cd project && git init`
- Added `SECRETS_SCAN_OMIT_PATHS` to netlify.toml to bypass false positive secrets detection

**Prevention Principles:**
1. **Verify git root before first commit** - Run `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` to confirm location
2. **Check pwd before git init** - Always `cd` to project folder first, confirm with `pwd`
3. **Inspect commit paths** - Use `git show --name-only` to verify files are at repo root, not nested
4. **Test deployment config locally** - Check if `netlify.toml` is at same level as `.git/`
5. **Use .gitignore to catch mistakes** - Home directory git would show thousands of untracked files as warning sign

---

### Slug-Filename Mismatch in Dynamic Routes (2025-10-31)

**Problem:**
- Blog posts showed "invalid date" error and didn't render
- Routes `/post/introducing-ecko` and `/post/ecko-principles` returned 404
- Blog.tsx slugs were `"introducing-ecko"` but files were `introducing-echo.md`
- Inconsistent naming convention: product name "Ecko" vs filename pattern "echo"

**Solution:**
- Changed Blog.tsx slugs to match actual filenames: `ecko` ‚Üí `echo`
- Updated `introducing-ecko` ‚Üí `introducing-echo` (line 28)
- Updated `ecko-principles` ‚Üí `echo-principles` (line 42)

**Prevention Principles:**
1. **Slugs must exactly match filenames** - Slug `"my-post"` requires file `my-post.md`, not `mypost.md`
2. **Verify routes immediately after creation** - Click blog post link to test before marking complete
3. **List files to confirm naming** - Use `ls public/content/blog/` to verify filenames match slugs
4. **Consistent naming convention** - Document whether product names get normalized (e.g., "Ecko" ‚Üí "echo")
5. **Automation should validate** - Content creation scripts should check file exists before adding to listing

description: Start blog writing workflow with style/principles/brief
---

Execute the complete writing workflow:

1. Read `.writing/style_reference.md` to absorb voice patterns from archived posts
2. Read `.writing/principles.md` for structural and tonal guidelines
3. Read `.writing/brief.md` to check current topic ideas
4. Read `.writing/angle.md` to see if there's active angle discussion
5. Ask user which topic from brief.md they want to develop, or if they want to add a new topic
6. Explore angles in `angle.md` and finalize approach
7. Draft in `co-edit.md` following style patterns and principles
8. Iterate based on user feedback in co-edit.md
9. When approved, publish to `public/content/blog/[slug].md` with proper frontmatter
10. Update `client/pages/Blog.tsx` to add post to blogPosts array
11. Remind user to archive the post in style_reference.md with analysis

Key principles to apply:
- Humble authority structure ("我不是X，但我知道Y")
- Temporal self-dialogue (write to past/future self)
- Numbered poetic sections (philosophy over function)
- Circular closure (return to opening image)
- Bilingual code-switching naturally
- Maximum 500 words
- Embodied abstraction, micro-narratives, incompleteness as honesty

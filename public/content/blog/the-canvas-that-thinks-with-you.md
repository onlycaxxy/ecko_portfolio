There's a moment in exam prep when the screen becomes the enemy. Tabs multiply. Word lists scroll. ChatGPT offers another study plan formatted in neat paragraphs. And somewhere between the vocabulary flashcards and the essay templates, the question arrives: where does any of this actually go?

I was studying for GRE and IELTS late into the night, drowning in 套路 templates and borrowed structures. Multiple choice worked fine—pattern recognition, elimination strategies. But writing from scratch? That required seeing the whole structure at once, and I had nothing but text scrolling past. Templates aren't thinking. They're inherited shapes that don't show how the pieces actually connect.

I kept watching the screen scroll. The structure lived in words, never in space.

## 一、觀察對話的邊界

I kept noticing how natural language AI asks us to describe everything. Talk to your assistant like a human. Explain what you need. It sounds elegant until you realize: some things can't be told, only shown.

I watched how children build with Lego blocks. They don't describe the castle—they place pieces, see connections, let structure emerge through hands. The thinking happens in building, not telling. That's when it became clear: most tools want chat first because that's easier to engineer, not because it's how humans actually think.

Every AI tool I tried said "type your problem, type again." The response explained "the best way to organize" but never showed the architecture—nodes connected, information flowing, steps visible. Advice lived in paragraphs. But understanding needs space.

## 二、重新放置畫布

I started scrolling through AI tools differently, looking for canvas features. They existed, always buried. Secondary views. Optional visualization. "You can also see your conversation as a diagram." As if arrangement in space was decoration, not foundation.

That's when the question shifted: what if the canvas came first?

So I built Hikki with canvas as primary interface. Thoughts placed, not described. Add a node for vocabulary clusters. Draw connections between essay structures. Watch study flow appear where everything stays visible. Chat becomes support—different voices for different modes, a tutor for structure, a collaborator for ideas, a coach for momentum—but thinking happens on canvas, where nothing scrolls away.

## 三、讓結構浮現

Hikki began from needing to see rather than explain. My exam prep transformed: vocabulary as clustered nodes instead of vertical lists, essay structures as connected diagrams instead of linear outlines. The entire process visible in space—what connects to what, what leads where, what comes next.

Like those Lego blocks I'd been watching. Each piece occupies space that can be seen. The picture builds through adding connections, removing what doesn't fit, rearranging until structure makes sense. Nothing vanishes. Nothing requires scrolling back through chat history to find what was discussed three screens ago.

My chaos settled into arrangement. Structure became visible. The breath returned.

I'm not saying chat has no place. But the order felt backwards. Conversations came first in AI development, and somewhere in the rush toward natural language, we forgot: **thinking happens in space**. Canvas-first isn't innovation. It's returning to how understanding actually forms—through seeing, arranging, building.

Back to basics. Back to blocks. The screen stopped feeling like an enemy once I could finally see where everything goes.

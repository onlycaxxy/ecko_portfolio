Sometimes research leads you sideways. You're looking for one thing and find something that names what you've already been doing.

I was working on my screenplay, trying to understand why my characters keep trying so hard for things that might not matter. Then I came across Joan Didion's *Play It as It Lays*. Maria drives the freeway in circles, lives in Hollywood glory, and stares into nothing. The contrast struck me—everything outside, void inside. She's had enough. She's broken in a way that makes drifting the only possible movement.

Months earlier, I'd watched *Daisies*. Two young women destroy banquets, cut their dresses with scissors, choose trifles to care about. The film dedicates itself to "those whose sole source of indignation is a trampled-on trifle." They're playful, lively, optimistic in their destruction. They choose lightness even as they wreck things.

## 一、當漂流遇上破壞

My characters don't drift. They can't choose lightness either.

They're trying hard—for school, for jobs, for life in general. C cares about grades even when her family says it doesn't matter. B destroys herself pursuing power she might not even want. A confesses to C precisely because it won't change anything. **They know these might be trifles. They can't stop caring anyway.**

## 二、研究中的發現

Reading Didion after watching *Daisies* showed me what I'd been writing without naming it: **exhausted caring**.

Not Maria's emptiness—my characters aren't broken enough to stop. Not the *Daisies* duo's play—they're not young or optimistic enough to make destruction fun.

They exist in between. Ordinary outside, exhausted inside, still trying.

## 三、靈感的糾纏

These works didn't teach me what to write. **They showed me what I'd already been writing.**

Maria's void helped me see my characters aren't empty—they're full of care they wish they could put down. The *Daisies* dedication reminded me that caring about trifles isn't weakness. It's its own truth.

My screenplay became the space between drift and destruction. Where people know better but can't stop. **Where trifles matter because we're the ones who decide to hold them.**

I'm still researching. Still writing. Still watching my characters try hard for things that might not matter. Maybe that's the point—the trying itself, the refusal to drift or destroy, the exhausted caring that keeps them moving.

Just like Maria on the freeway. But going somewhere.

### She Holds Spring

She holds spring against her breast and stares at me with sad eyes. Her smile shines, because the paper's glossy, and her cheeks are red. The sky behind her is the colour of light blue cloth. She has a sculpted, almost tiny mouth, and above its postcard expression her eyes keep staring at me with an enormous sorrow.

She came with Spring. Her eyes are large, but that's not what make them sad. I tear myself from the window violent steps. I cross the street and turn around with impotent indignation.

She still holds the spring she was given, ans her eyes are sad like all the things in life I've missed out on.

All of this makes me want to smile, but I feel a profound anxiety. i feel the chill of a sudden sickness in my soul. I don't have the strength to balk at this absurdity.

In my own way I sleep, without slumber or repose, this vegetative life of imagining, and the distant reflection of the silent street lamps, like the quiet foam of a dirty sea, hovers behind my restless eyebrows.

### Fragment 88 — The Poor Orphan

Who am I, finally, when I am not playing? A poor orphan left out in the cold among sensations, shivering on the street corners of reality, forced to sleep on the steps of sadness and to eat the bread offered by fantasy.

I was told that my father, whom I never knew is cold God, by the name means nothing to me. Sometimes at night, when I'm feeling lonely, I call out to him with tears and form an idea of him I can love. ben then it occurs to me that I don't know him, that perhaps he's not how I imagine, that perhaps this figure has never been the father of my soul...

All that remains of this is I, a poor abandoned child that no love wanted as its adopted son and no friendship accepted as its playmate.

### 她把春天擁於胸口

她把春天擁於胸口，用那雙悲傷的眼看著我。天在她身後如一塊淡藍色的布。她有張精巧且極小的嘴唇，在那之上明信片般靜止的表情，她的眼呈現出無限的憂傷盯著我。

她於春一同來，我邁著步子把自己從窗邊撕開，過了馬路我轉身，以無力的憤怒。

她仍然保有那被賜予的春天，眼仍然哀如世上吾人錯過的一切。

這一切使我忍不住微笑，同時也令我感受到一股深不見底的焦慮。我對我靈魂深藏的瘧病打了個顫·我無力阻止這荒謬。

我用我自己的方式睡覺，不用翻來覆去也不致昏頭，這樣睡眠的方式，這單調的想像，還有那從沈默街燈映過來的倒影，如一叢安靜的泡沫於一片污海，盤旋徘徊在我那永不停息的眉毛之上。

### 片段 88 — 可憐的孤兒

我只是一個除了寒冷別無所感的孤兒，在現實世界的街角發抖，在哀傷的步伐聲中我被迫入睡，起來吃幻夢捎給我的麵包...

有人告訴我，我那從沒謀面的父親叫做上帝，知道這個名字對我來說毫無意義。

有時夜晚我會害怕，我會哭著念著他的名字，然後幻想出一個我能夠愛的父親，然後意識到我根本不認識他，更甚，也許他不是我所想像的，也許那形象頁從來不是我靈魂的父親。

我抬頭望向天空，發現一切都沒有道理，留下的只有我，一個被拋棄的孩子，沒有愛願意降落，沒有情誼願意接受。

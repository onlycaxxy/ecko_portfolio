### Fragment 90 — The Marvel of Seeing

Anything and everything, depending on how one sees it, is a marvel or a hindrance, an all or a nothing, a path or a problem. To see something in constantly new ways is to renew and multiply it. That is why the contemplative person, without leaving his village, will nevertheless have the whole universe at his disposal. There's infinity in a cell or a desert. One can sleep cosmically against a rock.

At a certain point we are overwhelmed by a yearning of life, by a desire to know without the intellect, to meditate with only our senses, to think in a tactile or sensory mode, from inside the object of our thought, as if it were a sponge and we were water.

### Fragment 91 — The Dreamer's Superiority

There was a time when I was irritated by certain things that today make me smile. And one of those things, which I'm reminded of nearly of everyday, is the way men who are active in day-to-day life smile at poets and artists.

The dreamer isn't superior to the active man because dreaming is superior to reality. The dreamer's superiority due to the fact that dreaming is much more practical than living, and the dreamer gets far greater and more varied pleasure out of life than the man of action. In other and plainer words, the dreamer is the true man of action.

Life being fundamentally a mental state, and all that we do or think valid to the extent we consider it valid, the valuation depends on us.

The dreamer is an issuer of banknotes, and the notes he issues circulate in the city of his mind just like real notes in the world outside. Why should I care if the currency of my soul will never be convertible to gold, when there is no gold in life's factitious alchemy?

### Fragment 92 — Distant Dreams

All I asked of life is that it go on without me feeling it, all I demand of love is that it never stop being a distant dream. In my own landscapes, all of them unreal, I've always been attracted to what's in the distance, and the hazy aqueducts.

My bitterness over nostalgia's impotence to revie and resurrect becomes a tearful rage against god...

I was grieved by my inability to dream completely...

### Fragment 93 — Echo and Abyss

I've always suffered more from my consciousness that I was suffering than from the suffering of which I was conscious.

By thinking too much, I became echo and abyss. By delving within, I made myself into many. The slightest incident-a change in the light, the tumbling of a dry leave, the courtyard with an arch and houses clustered around it in the moonlight... all these things, although not mine, grab hold of my sensory attention with the chains of longing and emotion resonance. In each of these sensations I am someone else, painfully renewed in each indefinite impression.

I live off impression that aren't mine. I'm a squanderer of renunciations, someone else in the way I'm i.

### Fragment 94 — To Live is to Be Other

To live is to be other.

The dawn is the first dawn of the world. Never did this pink color yellowing to a warm white so tinge, towards the west, the face of the buildings whose windowpane eyes gaze upon the silence brought by the growing light. There was never this hour, nor this light, nor this person, that's me.

...and I love you from the deck rail as when two ships pass, and there's a mysterious longing and regret in their passing.

### Fragment 95

I suffered in me, with me, the aspirations of all ears, and every disquietude of every age walked with me to the whispering shore of the sea.

### Fragment 98 — Waking to Tedium

Today I woke up very early, wish a sudden and confused start, and I slowly got out of bed, suffocating from an inexplicable tedium. No dream had caused it, no reality could have created it.

A physical nausea, prompted by all of life, was born in the moment I woke up, a horror at the prospect of having to live got up with me out of bed.

### Fragment 138 — The Fifth Corner

True experience comes from restricting our contact with reality while increasing our analysis of that contact.

Condillac begins his celebrated book with, "No matter how high we climb or how low we descend, we never escape our sensations"...none of the four corners of the world is the one that interests me and that I can truly see; it's the fifth corner that I travel in, and it belongs to me.

Whoever has crossed all the seas has crossed only the monotony of himself.

In the countries that others go to, they go as anonymous foreigners. In the countries I've visited, I've been not only the secret pleasure of the unknown traveler, but also the majesty of the reigning king, the indigenous people and their culture, and the entire history of the nation and its neighbors.

I saw every landscape and every house because they were me, made in god from the substance of my imagination.

### Fragment 139 — Inward Stagnation

For a long time now I haven't written. Months have gone by in which I haven't lived, just endured, between office and physiology, in an inward stagnation of thinking and feeling. Unfortunately, this isn't even restful, since in rotting there's fermentation.

For a long time now I haven't written and haven't even existed.

For a long time now I haven't existed. I am utterly calm.

For a long time now I haven't been i.

### Fragment 143 — The Seamstress

I can't be too disappointed over not having become a. roman emperor, but I can sorely regret never once having spoken to the seamstress who at the street corner turns right at about nine o'clock every morning.

I sleep when I dream of what doesn't exist; dreaming of what might exist wakes me up.

My spirit abandons the material dimension.

Metaphysically abrupt arrival

### Fragment 144 — Sunday

It's Sunday and I have nothing to do. It's such a nice day that I don't even feel like dreaming. I enjoy it with all the sincerity of my senses, to which my intelligence bows.

Absurd diagonal of my sensations, sudden sound of an old carriage around the square, creaking its wheels in the depths of rhe car's noisy silences and somehow or other, by a maternal paradox of time, subsisting today, righthere between what I am and what I've lost, in my backward faze that is me...

### Fragment 145 — The American Millionaire

The American millionaire can't believe that posterity will appreciate his poems, given that he didn't write any. The sales representative can't imagine that the future will admire his pictures, since he never painted any.

### Fragment 148 — Notes in the Margin

Everything stated or expressed by man is a note in the margin of a completely erased text.

### Fragment 150 — Common Oblivion

Just as a common corpse is lowered into the common ground, so the equally useless corpse of the prose I wrote while waiting will be lowered into common oblivion.

### 片段 91 — 夢想者的優越性

夢想者是真正的行動者。夢想者像是鈔票的發行人，他的鈔票在他心中的世界中流通，就像真實的鈔票在世界流通一樣。

### 片段 93 — 回聲與深淵

因為像這樣想的太多，我變成了一聲回聲，一洞深淵。向內鑽，我把自身我變成了許多我。一些細小的事情，燈光换了，一隻枯葉在地上掙扎，這些體驗都不是我的，卻沿著追尋與同情的鎖鏈，緊緊地抓住了我的情感。

### 片段 143 — 裁縫師

對於我不是羅馬皇帝這事兒，我沒法太失望，我只能暗自後悔我從未和街口那每天早上九點準時走過的裁縫師說上話。

### 片段 145 — 美國富豪

一個人走得越高，他得捨棄的事物就越多。一個人越完美，也就越完整，而越完整，也就越缺少其他的一切。

我在報紙上看到一個擁有一切的美國富豪，對於他夢想的一切，錢、愛情、友情、認可、旅行、收藏品，他都可以達成。財富不能換來一切，不過那種讓他赚來那麼多錢的人格魅力卻能讓他獲得很多東西。

當我把報紙放下，我已經在開始思考像那個文章一樣聚焦的文章會怎麼下筆寫一位每天我身後的餐桌吃吃午餐的銷售員。那個美國富豪有的一切，那個人都有，當然，是更小的規格。當然，對他的體量來說算充分。他們的成功相同，甚至名聲也沒有不同，世界上有很多人都知道那位美國富豪的名字，在這條街上很多人都知道那位銷售員的名字。

他們緊緊抓住了他們雙臂張開所能擁有的一切，不同的只是他們手臂的長度。

### 片段 150 — 尋常的遺忘

正如一具屍體被壓入土中，我所書寫的一些尋常散文的屍體也將同樣無力地被按進尋常的遺忘中。

### Fragment 15 (Page 23)

Inch by inch I conquered the inner terrain I was born with. Bit by bit I reclaimed the swamp in which I languished. I gave birth to my infinite being, but I had to wrench myself out of me with forceps.

### Fragment 18 (Page 26)

I've great ambitious and boundless dreams, but so has the delivery boy or the seamstress, because everyone has dreams. What distinguishes certain of us is our capacity for fulfilling them, or out destiny that they be fulfilled.

In dreams I am equal to the delivery boy and the seamstress, I differ from them only in knowing how to write. Yes, writing is an act, a personal circumstance that distinguishes me from them. But in my soul, I am their equal.

Perhaps my destiny is to remain forever a bookkeeper, with poetry or literature as a butterfly that alights on my head, making me look ridiculous to the extent it looks beautiful.

### Fragment 19 (Page 25)

The magic power of words in isolation, or joined together on the basis of sound, with inner reverberation and divergent meanings even as they converge, the splendor of phrases inserted between the meanings of other phrases, the virulence of vestiges, the hope of the woods, and the absolute peacefulness of the ponds on the farms of my childhood of ruses...and so, within the high walls of absurd audacity, in the rows of trees and in the startled tremors of what withers, someone other than me would hear from sad lips that confession denied to more insistent parties.

### Fragment 20

Whenever I've tired to free my life from a set of the circumstances that continuously oppress it, I've been instantly surrounded by other circumstances of the same order, as if the inscrutable web of creation were irrevocably at odds with me. I yank from my neck when I freed it from the stranger's hand, when I gingerly remove the noose, it's with my own hands that I nearly strangle myself.

### Fragment 22

To love myself is to feel sorry for myself. Perhaps one day, towards the end of the future, someone will write a poem about me, and I'll begin to reign in my kingdom.

### Fragment 23

Let's act like sphinxes, however falsely, until we reach the point of no longer knowing who we are. For we are, in fact, false sphinxes, with no idea of we are in reality. The only way to be in agreement with life is to disagree with ourselves. Absurdity is divine.

Let's develop theories, patiently and honestly thinking them out, in order to promptly act against them---acting and justifying our action with new theories that condemn them.

Let's cut path in life and then go immediately against that path. Let's adopt all the poses and gestures of something we aren't and don't wish to be, and don't even wish to be taken for being.

Let's buy books so as not to read them; let's go to concerts without caring to hear the music or see who's there; lets take long walks because we're sick of walking; and lets spend the whole days in the country, just because it bores us.

### 片段 15（第23頁）

一片一片地，我又回到了內心那塊蓬地，我把無限的我帶來這個世界上，也不停地將我從自身上用力扳開。

### 片段 18（第26頁）

也許我的命運是繼續做一個圖書管理員，有文學和詩歌像蝴蝶那樣與我嬉戲，環繞在我的頭頂上，讓我看起來好像瘋了，卻又太瘋幾乎美麗。

### 片段 19（第25頁）

文字的魔力在於它的孤立，或它在言語铿锵中的團結。

在聲音否認反響和分歧的語意中，雍容的詞語穿插在其他的詞語中，遺毒與希望，我童年惡作劇中平靜的湖面。正因為如此，在成排的荒謬和樹林的搖擺顫抖中，某人會從一雙悲傷的唇中聽到一段無法堅持的自白。

### 片段 20

不可測之網中的一切都以一種不可說的方式與我發生巧合，我拉向扣在我頸上的手，然候看間了纏在那之上的一道繩索，我剛從他人手中解開，自愛是一種自戀。

### 片段 22

自愛是一種自憐。當某人為我寫了一首詩，我將得以主宰我的心。

### 片段 23

唯一一條與眼前生活達成共識的那條路，那就是和自己一同處於異議當中，荒謬乃治。

讓我們一起創造理論，耐心而誠實地思考他們，在行動上完全地違背他們，然後再創造出新的理論去合理化那些行動，然後重複思考它們，去證實那些新的理論。

讓我們一起買書然後再也不碰，一起聽場我們不在乎音樂如何，藝術家如何的表演，一起散散步因為我們厭倦走路，一起在鄉間度過一天只因為我們無所事事。

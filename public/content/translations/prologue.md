### Prologue

I believe in *responsible creation*: not style as ornament, but as a change in how we see.

Fragments drift. Noise settles. The page remembers and forgets. I keep what remains: a soft melancholy that sharpens into clarity.

### Fragments

In 2am, your sleeping eyes look to the side — smoke. smoke. smoke. you say nothing; I understand: it was just smoke.

How busy, how noisy, the pressure of living alone. Slow buildings collapse inward; I bike without destination, then eat, read, and it feels okay. (enough.)

### From Pessoa — The Book of Disquiet

> "To create, I destroyed myself. I fixed myself in the shape of a thing and so left myself outside."

*Translated excerpt; the act of translation is a mirror of my own fragmentation.*

### 序

我相信「責任性的創作」：不是為了裝飾的風格，而是改變「看」的方式。

碎片漂移，噪點落塵。頁面記得，也遺忘。我留下殘餘：一種柔軟的憂鬱，最後轉為清明。

### 片段

凌晨兩點，你側看，煙、煙、煙。你沒有說話；我懂，那只是煙。

一個人生活的壓力又忙又吵。大樓慢慢向內塌陷；我一直騎車，沒有終點。然後買早餐、坐著、讀書。覺得還好——已經足夠。

### 佩索阿《不安之書》

> 「為了創造，我毀滅了自己。我把自己固定成某種形狀，因此把自己留在外面。」

*翻譯也是鏡子；我在碎裂中看見自己。*
